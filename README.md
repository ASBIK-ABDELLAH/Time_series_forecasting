# Time_series_forecasting

Building forecasting models for photovoltaic yield, Green Energy Park.\
We Used the data collected by the Green Energy Park, which contains the weather condition every 2 minutes during 2 years, 2018 and 2019, and our target, the photovoltaic yield. We used those measurements to create two forecasting statistics models, AR and ARIMA, and then create a deep learning model, LSTM. Finally, we compared all of them to come up with what we see the best one in term of complexity, accuracy and time of execution.\
Tasks:\
• From SQL database to docker notebook\
• Preprocessing data (pandas)\
• Removing outliers\
• Building forecasting models\
Tools: SQL, Docker, Python, Preprocessing, Visualization, AR model, ARIMA model, LSTM model.
